# Towers of Hanoi

Write a Towers of Hanoi game.

Keep three arrays, which represent the piles of discs. Pick a representation of
the discs to store in the arrays; maybe just a number representing their size.
Don't worry too much about making the user interface pretty.

In a loop, prompt the user (using gets) and ask what pile to select a disc from,
and where to put it.

After each move, check to see if they have succeeded in moving all the discs, to
the final pile. If so, they win!

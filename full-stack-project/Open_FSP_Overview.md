# Full Stack Project

The Full Stack Project is the final project in the App Academy Full Stack
Developer Curriculum. Here you will take the skills and knowledge that you have
gained throughout the course and use it to make your first Full Stack
Application. You will use Ruby on Rails in conjunction with React and Redux to
make a single page application clone of an existing website. This module has
resources to help you on your way to building this application over the next two
weeks. This is the time for you to revisit readings, videos, and other
documentation from previous weeks as well as searching things up on your own
just as you will in your careers. Make the most of your independence as you
problem solve and manage your schedules to complete your project in time. This
will be the centerpiece of your future portfolios and your efforts and diligence
here will show in the functionality and appearance of your final product.


Good Luck Programmers!

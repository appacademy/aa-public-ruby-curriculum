# Tentative Project Proposal

Before we ask you to pour your heart and soul into crafting a polished, thorough
blueprint for your full-stack project, we want to be doubly sure that your core
idea is strong enough not only to stand on its own, but to really impress
employers. We also want to encourage some variety among full-stack projects;
this helps distinguish graduates from each other and is good for the class as a
whole.

To facilitate this, we're going to have you submit to us your top three project
choices. You'll do this through a Google form we send to your email. Your
choices for clones are available in the MVP List reading linked in the sidebar,
as well as the required features for each project.

At most, one of your choices can be a project of your own design; in this case,
select "Other" and write a brief outline in the provided text field (details
below). Slight modifications to a website are not considered your own design. It
will be considered your own design if either there is no current precedent for
that content or the site you want to clone is not on the approved list.

**NB** We highly encourage you to save your own brilliant website idea until
after the Flex project. Full stack and Flex are huge learning experiences and
you will make many mistakes along the way. And you probably don't want your
awesome implementation littered with learning experiences. Also, not having a
website to copy adds a _lot_ of extra planning and design. Keep these things in
mind.

## Project Outline

This is only required if you're proposing a project not on the approved list,
but it's a good exercise even if you're planning a straight, no-frills clone.
You should write a bulleted list of the features you will need to implement for
your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Your MVP list should contain **four key
features** for your app. Any additional features should be marked `bonus`.

Think carefully about this, but don't spend more than 30 minutes actually
writing the outline. The idea is not to sit down and plan everything out in
minute detail. That will come in the next part of the project. Instead, consider
this a sales pitch. Give us enough detail to show that the project has merit and
that you have a game plan for making it happen.

### Example

#### Project: Twitter Clone

**Summary:** Twitter is a social media app that allows users to publicly share
short 'chirps' (tweets) of text.

**Key Feature Set:**

0. Users can create, view, and edit chirps that are viewable by any other user
1. Users have a private dashboard of other user's chirps and a public profile
   view of their own chirps
1. Users can follow other users to filter the chirps on their dashboard
1. Users can search for other users
1. Bonus: hashtag incorporation in text and rechirps (retweets)

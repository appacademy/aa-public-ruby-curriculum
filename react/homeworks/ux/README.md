# JotItDown

This exercise will help you practice creating usable, visually pleasing
layouts around existing content.

You will apply the UX concepts you know to create CSS layouts for the `index.html` 
and `splash.html` pages of a note-taking app. You will need to reorganize the
information, apply relevant markup, and add styling.

Tips:
* Keep visual hierarchy and web layout conventions in mind.
* Don't forget to add signifiers (e.g., the shape and color of elements, cursor effects, hover effects).
* If you feel stuck, refer to existing note-taking apps for inspiration.

Begin by downloading the [skeleton][skeleton].

## Splash

Edit the `splash.html` page's html and create styles for its elements
in `styles.css`. Your goal is to make it look similar to simple splash pages 
like [Evernote's][evernote] or [OneNote's][onenote].
Create and style a nav bar, style and position the hero image (the large
image towards the top of the page), and add signifiers for users to sign up
/ sign in / sign out.

## Index

Edit the html in `index.html` and create styles for its elements. Your
goal here is to create a conventional index page of a note-taking app.
You can look to [Evernote][evernote], [OneNote][onenote],
[Asana][asana], and other similar applications for inspiration.

Organize and wrap the given content in the appropriate html elements, then write
styles for each element in `styles.css`. You are allowed to rearrange the 
content if you think it would make more sense in a different order; you can also 
add content and edit the existing content if you would like more information to 
be displayed.

You should create html elements and styles for:
* Nav bar
* Footer
* List container
* List Item
* Search Form
* New List Form
* New Item Form

When you're done, compare your work against [some real examples][screenshots].

# Bonus

- Make sure your site meets [web-accessibility standards][standards].
- Implement a color scheme for your site. Your scheme should have 3 colors:
background, main, and accent. You can get inspiration from [colourlovers][colors].
- Add custom [fonts][fonts]. You should have a header font and a body font.

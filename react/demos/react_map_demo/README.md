# React Map Demo

This [demo][skeleton] shows you how to integrate the Google Maps API into a 
React project, like we will be doing tomorrow when we add a map to display all 
of our benches in BenchBnB!  

Please read through the `index.html` and `map.jsx` files to see how map 
integration is achieved.  `map.jsx` has detailed comments explaining every line 
of code. Understanding this demo is crucial to your success on tomorrow's project.

# Containers

As you saw in the `Provider` and `connect()` readings,
there can be quite a bit of code involved in connecting a component to the
store. Putting all this code into the component with heavy rendering logic tends
to cause bloated components and violates the principle of separation of
concerns. Therefore, it's a common pattern in Redux code to separate
**presentational components** from their connected counterparts, called
**containers**.

The distinction between presentational components and containers is not
technical but rather functional. Presentational components are concerned
with how things look and container components are concerned with how
things work.

Here's a table outlining the differences:

|                | Presentational                   | Container                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose        | How things look (markup, styles) | How things work (data fetching, state updates) |
| Aware of Redux | No                               | Yes                                            |
| To Read Data   | Read data from `props`           | Subscribe to Redux state                       |
| To Change Data | Invoke callbacks from `props`    | Dispatch Redux actions                         |
| Are Written    | By hand                          | Generated by `React-Redux` `connect()`         |

## Choosing Containers

Not every component needs to be connected to the store. Generally, you will only 
want to create containers for the 'big' components in your app that represent 
sections of a page, and contain smaller purely functional presentational 
components. These larger container components are responsible for mapping state 
and dispatch props that can be passed down to all their presentational children.

Below is a project file tree that demonstrates how containers might be arranged
in a folder for lists.

```
components
  + list
    + list_container.jsx
    + list.jsx
    + list_item.jsx
```

Notice that containers exist in the same folder as presentational components and 
that the container file is named list_container.jsx and not just list.jsx.

In general, aim to have fewer containers rather than more. Most of the 
components we will write will be presentational, but we'll need to generate a 
few containers to connect presentational components to the Redux store of our 
apps.

Let's take a close look at an example with presentational and container 
components. We'll use the example of lists from the file tree above.

## Example

### Container Component

```jsx
// components/list/list_container.jsx

import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { resetItems } from '../../actions/items' // action creator
import List from '../list'; // presentational component to connect

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({ // map slice of state to props object
	items: state.items
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({ // create action dispatcher
	resetItems: () => dispatch(resetItems());
});

const ListContainer = connect(
	mapStateToProps,
	mapDispatchToProps
)(List);

export default ListContainer;
```

`ListContainer` serves as an interface between the store and the component it
wraps. It's necessary to import `List` at the top of the file, as well as 
actions we plan to dispatch.

### Presentational Components

#### `List` Component

```jsx
// components/list/list.jsx

import React from 'react';
import Item from 'components/list/item';

const List = ({ items, resetItems }) => {
	const listItems = items.map((item, idx) => (
		<Item key={idx} item={item} />
	);

	return (
		<div className="list">
			<h1 onClick={resetItems}>
				Click to Reset
			</h1>
			<ul className='list-items'>
				{listItems}
			</ul>
		</div>
	);
};

export default List;
```

`List` receives props from `ListContainer`, deconstructed here as `items` and `resetItems`.

In `List` we pass as props individual `items` to `Item`, delegating the
responsibility of rendering individual list items to that component.

#### `Item` Component

```jsx
// components/list/item.jsx
import React from "react";

const Item = ({ item }) => (
  <div className="list-item">
    <h3>{item.name}</h3>
    <span>{item.body}</span>
  </div>
);

export default Item;
```

And finally, `Item` receives as props a single `item`, rendering that item's
name and body.

# Project README style guide

* Demo README outline

## Rules

* When updating a project, the individual doing the updating must make
make sure the project README is current with this style guide's rules.
* Each project begins with a title and "Learning Goals" section.
* Project directions are organized in phases.
* Phases are titled "Phase 1: Lorem Ipsum", "Phase 2: Lorem Ipsum".
* Phase 1 is always the setup phase and is titled "Phase 1: Setup"
* Each phase consists of three sections: "Overview", "Steps", "Recap".
* For phases with a smaller number of directions that can't be easily broken up into sections, it's ok to leave out the "Overview", "Steps", and "Recap" headers.
* Bonus phases are titled "Bonus phase 1: Lorem Ipsum", "Bonus phase 2: Lorem Ipsum".
* Deep-dive or additional information should be placed in an `Aside`.
* Always refer to the [project README example](https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/sql/projects/url_shortener/README.md).

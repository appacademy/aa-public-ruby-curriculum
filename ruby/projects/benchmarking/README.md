# Benchmarking

Ruby includes a Benchmark module in the standard library to test the execution
time of code. This can be very useful if you need to approximate the real-world
performance of different algorithms to determine which one is best for your
particular application.

Go back through the day's solutions and use `Benchmark` to verify the **Big-O**
performance of your various solutions. You can find the docs
[here][benchmark-docs], and there's an example of how to use it in the [sorting
complexity demo][sorting-demo] from the Sorting Complexity reading.

# Agile

Agile is a rapid application software development methodology that focuses on
highly iterative design. The term was coined in 2001 with the publication of the
*Manifesto for Agile Software Development*, which was written by a group of
software developers who wanted to share what they had learned about project
management. Agile is the latest popular example of a lightweight software
development method. The first of these were developed in the 1990s as an
alternative to the prevailing heavyweight methods, which were heavily
micro-managed and rigidly planned. Many of Agile's lightweight predecessors are
now considered agile methods.

Agile methodology operates on a number of core principles. Key to these
principles is the idea of rapid, iterative design. The agile philosophy is that
a product should be broken up into small parts that can be rapidly developed so
that results can be shown to the client constantly. If the requirements for any
piece of the product or the whole product itself should change at any point, the
team can respond quickly to those changes because they haven't been developing
something too unwieldy to redesign.

Team management is also critical. Each team must be **cross-functional** -- that
is, a team that can organize and manage itself throughout the entirety of their
piece of the project and each iteration of that piece. This means that a single
team is continuously working in every step of development, from planning and
design, to coding and testing. It can therefore respond quickly to any changes,
instead of needing to wait upon another department or team.

Agile development has become the norm. While each company might have their own
personalized implementation of agile, the basic principles are incredibly
popular. Companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, and even teams
at Google are using agile methodologies to respond to the needs of their clients
and to rapidly get products published.

## Terms

**Co-location** is a critical part of agile methodology. This is the idea that a
team is all working out of the same space. Face to face communication allows for
team building, faster communication and collaboration, and an easier time
responding to the iterative process of agile development.

**Pair programming** is an agile technique that results in a significant
improvement to product quality. Two people approaching a task bring with them
different backgrounds, experiences, information, and expertise. Open discussion
about how to approach and solve a particular problem often leads to a better
solution than a programmer working solo, who might try to implement the first
solution they devise.

**Test-driven development** leads to more agile code. The better unit tests are
in place, the easier it is to keep code error-free and rapidly iterate upon it.
Writing tests before writing code means that all the design work is done first,
so that the product will do exactly what it needs to do. Similarly,
**refactoring** is a key principle. Because each piece of code is iterated upon
so often in the agile process, constant refactoring is important to keep clutter
down and to keep code easy to maintain. With the presence of tests, developers
can refactor safely, knowing that their refactoring won't have broken a key
aspect of their product.

**Continuous integration** is the process of integrating newly developed code
back into a main branch multiple times a day. With robust enough tests in place,
code can safely be merged as soon as even a small feature is complete. This
prevents needing to reconcile massive merge conflicts, which can be fairly
common if multiple developers were working on multiple feature branches.
Resolving these conflicts can sometimes take longer than writing the feature
itself.

## Alternatives

One of the oldest methodologies is the **waterfall** method. In the waterfall
method, each phase in the development process is fully completed before moving
on to the next one. For example, all the planning and design gets done and is
approved before any of the coding starts, and all the code gets written before
any testing happens. While this does lead to a well-documented, very stable path
of development, the process does not lend itself well to any alterations made to
the product partway through the process.

**Prototyping** consists of making multiple prototypes that will eventually be
refined towards a final product. This allows a client to provide feedback on
these prototypes and get a sense of actually working with the product, instead
of having to produce feedback based only on documentation or descriptions.

The **spiral** method is an iterative design methodology that blends aspects of
other methodologies based on risk analysis. Each iteration goes through distinct
phases, and repeatedly passes through these phases until completion. Depending
on the stage of development and the risk factors involved, the spiral method
pulls in elements of the waterfall method, prototyping, or a basic incremental
method in which projects are built in small pieces at a time.

Create a `.content-header` section and put it at the top inside of the
`.content` container, above the sidebar and main section. Give it a height and
use the supplied `../images/cats.jpg` as a background. Make sure the background
image covers the full section.

Add a heading and button and position them absolute at the bottom. To keep the
heading legible on a varied background, use the `text-shadow` property to
increase contrast.

For headings with a large `font-size` that do not wrap multiple lines, we like
to decrease the `line-height` as it will add a decent chunk of additional space
above and below the words, which is only needed if we have multiple lines. Let's
get rid of that space by setting `line-height` to `1` on our header.

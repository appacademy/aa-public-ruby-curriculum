Reuse your `.thumb` class. Use flexbox to position the thumbnail and the form
next to each other. Wrap your inputs and labels in container elements with an
`.input` class. Wrap the button in a `.submit` container. Style them so you can
reuse them. Pay special attention to the `:focus` and ':active' pseudo-classes.


**Bonus**: CSS can do math too! Though not required today, you may use the
`calc()` function. It can be especially nice to do math with combined
units. For instance, you can easily subtract 100px off of a 100%
width, by setting `width: calc(100% - 100px)`. You can do addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can even use
parentheses to denote order.

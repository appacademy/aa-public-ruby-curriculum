## HTML Semantic Containers Exercise

Take [yesterday's solution][prev-solution] from HTML Introduction Exercise and add some more semantic structure:

1. Create a `header` section at the top
2. Add an `img` of the app-academy logo within the header section
3. Add a `nav` element within the header, after the logo
4. Cut and paste your unordered list of anchor links into the nav section
5. Add an `aside` element
6. Cut and paste all of the ingredients elements into the aside
7. Put the recipe image inside of a `figure` element
8. Add a `figcaption` element below the figure
9. Cut the link to wikipedia from your description paragraph and paste it into the `figcaption` element
10. Add a `section` element to contain the figure, description and instruction elements
11. Add a `footer` element at the bottom
12. Add a `p` element in the footer with some text/link about where the recipe originated from

After coding your recipe page, compare your html to [this example][solution].

# Screenshots to CSS

Here are today's CSS exercises.

For each exercise, make a new html and css file.

Start analyzing the layout by thinking of everything as being
contained in boxes. Then find all horizontally adjacent boxes, and
draw a grouping box that wraps them. Many boxes probably will be
nested several levels deep. You will use floats (and the clearfix we
talked about) to align these horizontally.

Now that you have a mental model of the boxes on the page, start
crafting your html document. Think about using correct semantic tags.
Look at the html reference. The better your markup, the easier your
styling will be.

Next move on to css. Don't forget to write a reset for the tags you
used, as to avoid browser styling conflicts. Start with common tags
and the most outer elements, getting the big picture right. Then focus
on individual sections. Just like the coding you've done so far,
experiment, try different approaches, iterate quickly, and refactor.

Any time you encounter images in the design, you may substitute them
with any of your own liking, or even just a colored div as a
placeholder. If you are in need of icons, go ahead and use unicode
icons (like the ones you used with chess). You could also use the web
inspector to copy the actual image resources, but this is not
required. Some may use complicated sprites that would set you back.

Do not worry about shading, shadows, glows, texture, or even the exact
shade of color. The core of today's exercises is that you get the
positioning and markup right. The rest is simply icing on the cake.

Do not worry about responsiveness and interactivity. As a bonus, you
may attempt to add such features once done. We will talk more in depth
about those things later in the course.

Do not look at the stylesheets of the websites, but rather take a
screenshot and recreate the page, using just that image.

Tip: use `cmd + shift + 4` to get the Mac screenshot tool. I use this
to measure dimensions all the time. After clicking and dragging you
see the little dimension numbers. Then hit escape to stop, without
actually taking a screenshot.

You can also zoom your screen using `ctrl + scroll` to inspect what is
really going on on a pixel level.

If you open the images or screenshots in the Preview app, you also get
a crosshair which you can use to measure element dimensions. Make sure
you keep the image open at 100% (actual size).
